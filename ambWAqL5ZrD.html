					<h2>What is Calisthenics(calisthenics)?</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>What is Calisthenics(calisthenics)?</strong> Now most people spend their free time doing exercises, which is not surprising, given the plethora of workout types available.But not everyone has the opportunity to go to the gym, or even to the shopping center in search of equipment. People use their own initiative to tackle their personal fitness needs. And it's clear that passion for fitness and activity is much more important for them than the fact that they look like someone did it for you.Here are some tips that will help you master this important aspect of life, making your workouts more effective.Calisthenics are self-healing exercises that target the nervous system. They are aimed at combating the loss of neurons (nerve pain), the symptoms of which are often associated with weakness or trauma. An active lifestyle includes practicing sports, working out in the gym, or even relaxing. And as a result, the loss of neurons occurs less often than with intensive training and proper nutrition. In addition, recovering from a stroke receives better neurological activity, which promotes recovery. After a workout, there is a temporary release of glycogen, which is stored in the liver and muscles. This temporarily, but after long-term, it is released back into the blood. Thus, neurons that are synapses in the spinal cord are not damaged, and they can be re-established. In addition, regular training in the gym improves cognitive abilities and improves attention, which is of great benefit to physically and psychologically.How to start practicing calisthenicsPractice at home. Begin by warming up, getting ready for a workout. Work out for at least 20 minutes per workout, and try to do as much as you can. Gradually, increase the number of repetitions and the pace. Make it a goal to spend at least 30 minutes working out per week. And make it a habit. This is a phase, a transitional phase, a way to the better side. After recovery, you can not work out in the gym again without breaking a few rules. Rules for starting calisthenics:No unnecessary movements. The body must be kept in the correct position. Keep your muscles toned and flexible. The back must be straight. Your feet should not touch the floor. Your wrists should be immobile. Your shoulders should be gently bent. Your head should be straight. You should try hard to keep your body in the correct position.This is one small rule that will help you master this incredibly difficult sport. Another is that you should practice everyday. That is, if you want to become a better calisthenician, you need to do your exercises every day. Otherwise, the increase of performance will be minimal. daily.3. Proper breathingDuring training sessions, we constantly need to take a deep breath and inhale during training. Calisthenics can help you achieve this goal. The most important thing
