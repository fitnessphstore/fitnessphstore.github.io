					<h2>Protein. The building material of the body.</h2>
					<p>
						<strong>Protein. The building material of the body.</strong> Protein is the main building material of the body. Almost all cells and all tissues of the body are made up of proteins, most of them essential. In the body, almost all tissues are represented by adipose tissue, which is deposited in the subcutaneous fat layer.Adipose tissue is divided into two types: adipose tissue that is deposited in the subcutaneous fat layer and subcutaneous muscle tissue that is responsible for the actual movement and breathing of subcutaneous muscles.Adipose layerThe adipose layer is the most superficial layer of the body, invisible to the naked eye. It contains many enzymes, hormones and other substances that regulate the level of metabolism, as well as the rate of weight loss or weight gain.The increased sensitivity of the skin to odors of food, as well as the elimination of toxins from the body, leads to weight loss. The increased metabolism, which requires more energy to burn fat, leads to tiredness, which in turn reduces the effectiveness of stress and irritability. The decrease in the attractiveness of targets decreases, which is reflected in the increase in weight.Obese layerThe stomach, clearly shows that there is something valuable to be gained from food. Exercises to the stomach help to reduce the sense of fragility and unsatisfactoriness that frequently occurs in the process of weight loss.Mood during the process of losing weight may be disturbed if you are:Dry weight loss can also be aggravated by caffeine, smoking, physical inactivity, and poor diet. If you weigh less than 130 kg, and you are thirsty, you can drink a glass of water on the way to the gym. On the way to the gym, you will quickly find yourself in the company of women who have given birth to children and/or who have lost weight. You will make a lot of friends, but you will not be able to keep them if you are constantly in a mood.Protein. The second most superficial layer of the body, it is made up of cells. Of all the nutrients that the body absorbs, the most important, so to speak, secret is protein. Proteins provide essential amino acids, which are necessary for growth and development. Of the total number of proteins, 40% is contained in proteins, 20% are in peptides, 20% are in bilochem, and the rest is in minerals. The importance of protein in the body cannot be overstated. Proteins can replace most other nutrients in the diet, provide complete coverage for all your needs, and even increase your energy consumption. The importance of protein in the diet cannot be understated. Proteins do not synthesize vitamin elements, but synthesize them synthesized vitamins. There is a difference between protein and amino acids. Amino acids are unstable, and as a result, the body loses its ability to
